C# implemetns  - Array.Reverse & Array.Sort
Field VS property - interfaces can have properties but not fields. Property does not need to implemetn fileds
Class VS structure - inheritance, parameterised constructor, value Vs ref , no 'new' needed
Default access specifier for a class type is internal. Default access for the members is private.
