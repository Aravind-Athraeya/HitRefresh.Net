Why collections are virtual in dbcontext? BEcause to facilitate lazy loading 
1-Navigation property should be defined as public, virtual. Context will NOT do lazy loading if the property is not defined as virtual.
2- When using POCO entity types, lazy loading is achieved by creating instances of derived proxy types and then overriding virtual properties to add the loading hook.
Change tracking - To track any entity by the context, it must have the primary key property.
