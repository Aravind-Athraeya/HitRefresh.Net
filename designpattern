Prototype
Command pattern : All requests are treated as objects
Ptototype pattern: clone existing object
Dependency injection pattern & IOC -allows us to develop loosely coupled code. DI is a great way to reduce tight coupling between software components
he Dependency Injection pattern uses a builder object to initialize objects and provide the required dependencies to the object means it allows you to "inject" a dependency from outside the class.

Inversion of Control (IoC) means to create instances of dependencies first and latter instance of a class (optionally injecting them through constructor), instead of creating an instance of the class first and then the class instance creating instances of dependencies.
Observer pattern:
 one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
 Node.js works on observers pattern and event driven

Stategy pattern: Family of algrothims - Composition VS inheritance -- So is a(inheritance )/ has a relationship(car has a engine)
