=== VS == 

var x = "John";             
var y = new String("John");
var z = new String("John");

// (x == y) is true because x and y have equal values
// (x === y) is false because x and y have different types (string and object)
// (z == y) is false because x and y are different objects
// (z === y) is false because x and y are different objects
indexOf() VS search()
Substring VS slice - 
JavaScript will try to convert strings to numbers in all numeric operations

parseInt("10 20 30");   // returns 10
parseInt("10 years");   // returns 10
parseInt("years 10");   // returns NaN
