If you re-declare a JavaScript variable, it will not lose its existing value.
JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. so 16 + 4 + "Volvo"; will produce 20Volvo while  "Volvo" + 16 + 4 will produce Volvo164
You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:
Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.You can consider it a bug in JavaScript that typeof null is an object. It should be null.
Difference Between Undefined and Null
If you access a method without the () parentheses, it will return the function definition
=== VS == 

var x = "John";             
var y = new String("John");
var z = new String("John");

// (x == y) is true because x and y have equal values
// (x === y) is false because x and y have different types (string and object)
// (z == y) is false because x and y are different objects
// (z === y) is false because x and y are different objects
indexOf() VS search()
Substring VS slice - 
JavaScript will try to convert strings to numbers in all numeric operations
Infinity, NaN = type number -Any operation with Nan returns Nan
parseInt("10 20 30");   // returns 10
parseInt("10 years");   // returns 10
parseInt("years 10");   // returns NaN 
The Difference Between Arrays and Objects - Named indexes VS Numbered indexes
shift VS pop 
Array - Push, Pop,shift(removed from front), Slice(make new array from given element. Makes a copy does not remove), Splice(remove from array)
Array.map/ reduce /filter /every /some
Switch cases use strict comparison (===).The values must be of the same type to match.
Number("99 88")   // returns NaN
PasseInt("99 88")   // returns 99
If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable.
Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope
let/const/ block scope
var vs let difference in javascript
The super() method refers to the parent class.
